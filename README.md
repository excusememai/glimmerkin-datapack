游린 Brittle Resilience: Glimmerkin delicate, crystal-like nature renders them more vulnerable to physical harm than other beings in the Minecraft realm, resulting in limited maximum health and increased susceptibility to injuries and perilous situations. This leads to a decrease in saturation as well as slower regen.

游린 Sunlight Aversion: Despite their ethereal nature, Glimmerkin possess a strong aversion to direct sunlight, experiencing unease and vulnerability when exposed to its rays. This discomfort slows them down and makes them more susceptible to harm.
